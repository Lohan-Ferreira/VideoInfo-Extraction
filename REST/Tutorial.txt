Initialization:
	-Run blazegraph: java -jar blazegraph.jar
	-Run rest server: python3 rest.py

Sending video data to server to be stored on bank X(Integer):
	curl -F "upfile=@file.zip" -F bankid=X 'http://localhost:5000/api/upload'

	Expected zip file must have: a directory with transcripts, "seg.txt" and .json with scenes distribution
	(For an exemple check video.zip within this directory)


HOW IT WORKS?
Videos sent to server will be stored in a personal directory called "bank_setups". Inside it you
will find many directories with numbers that are related to a specific namespace on blazegraph.
When a video sent requests a new namespace, a new one is created in blazegraph and a new directory 
in the server to keep it.
Blazegraph keeps on each namespace:
	-Topic count for each video
	-Timestart for each topic
	-Similarity value between topics
